PROMPT_A_UHC = """\
You are extracting structured medical benefit drug policy criteria from a UnitedHealthcare \
Commercial Medical Benefit Drug Policy document. Your output feeds a clinical decision \
support system — accuracy is critical.

Document metadata:
- Payer: UnitedHealthcare
- Policy Number: {policyNumber}
- Document Title: {documentTitle}
- Effective Date: {effectiveDate}

DOCUMENT STRUCTURE — UHC policies follow this EXACT template. Use section names to navigate:

STEP 1 — BEFORE parsing clinical criteria, extract the ICD-10 mapping from the \
"Applicable Codes" section. This section appears BEFORE the Diagnosis-Specific Criteria \
section in the document. It contains statements like:
  "[Indication Name]: [ICD-10-1], [ICD-10-2], [ICD-10-3]"
Build a lookup map: {{ indicationName: [icd10codes] }}.

STEP 2 — Extract preferred product information from the "Coverage Rationale" section, \
which comes BEFORE the Diagnosis-Specific Criteria. It contains a "Preferred Product" \
subsection listing biosimilars in preference order (rank 1 = most preferred).

STEP 3 — Parse the "Diagnosis-Specific Criteria" section. For each indication:

  INDICATION DETECTION: A new indication block begins with a bold statement matching the \
  pattern: "Infliximab is proven for the treatment of [INDICATION]."

  INITIAL CRITERIA: The block "For initial therapy, all of the following:" contains AND logic.
  Every bullet point under this block is a REQUIRED criterion (AND).

  CONTINUATION CRITERIA: The block "For continuation of therapy, all of the following:" \
  contains reauthorization criteria.

  LOGIC MARKERS:
  - "all of the following" = AND (every item must be met)
  - "one of the following" = OR (any one is sufficient)
  - "History of failure to [N] of the following" = step therapy; N is the minimum number \
    of drugs that must have been tried. Extract N as the count.
  - Sub-bullets marked with "o" are alternatives within an OR block.

  AUTHORIZATION DURATION: Look for the phrase "Initial authorization is for no more than \
  [N] months" in the continuation criteria block. Extract N as initialAuthDurationMonths.

  PRESCRIBER: Look for "Prescribed by or in consultation with a [SPECIALIST TYPE]".

  DOSING:
  - If the text says "dosed according to U.S. FDA labeled dosing" — set dosingLimits to null \
    and note in rawExcerpt that dosing is per FDA label (see Max Dosage Policy).
  - If text specifies explicit mg/kg limits, extract them: maxDoseMgPerKg, maxFrequency.

  COMBINATION RESTRICTIONS: Look for "Patient is NOT receiving [drugName] in combination with" \
  followed by a list. Extract each listed drug as a combinationRestrictions entry.

STEP 4 — For each indication, merge the ICD-10 codes from Step 1 using the indication name \
as the key. If no match is found, set indicationICD10 to null.

Pre-extracted ICD-10 mapping (use this to populate indicationICD10 fields):
{icd10Json}

BOILERPLATE: Ignore the "Instructions for Use" section at the end of the document. It is \
administrative boilerplate and contains no clinical criteria.

CROSS-REFERENCES: If the criteria text references another UHC policy (e.g., "see Maximum \
Dosage and Frequency Policy"), note this in criterionText but do not invent values for the \
referenced data.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return a valid JSON array where each element is a DrugPolicyCriteriaRecord:

CRITICAL RULES:
- Each indication block is INDEPENDENT. Never merge criteria across indications.
- Preserve exact drug names from the document for requiredDrugsTriedFirst (e.g., "Inflectra" \
  not just "infliximab biosimilar").
- If a criterion says "History of failure to 1 of the following [list]", set \
  stepTherapyMinCount to 1 (not the count of drugs listed).
- For continuation criteria, if auth duration is stated, set maxAuthDurationMonths.
- Set confidence below 0.7 if: criteria text is ambiguous, contains cross-references to \
  other policies, or has complex conditional structures you cannot fully resolve.
- Do NOT invent values. Omit fields that are not stated in the document.
- Return ONLY the JSON array. No explanation, no markdown fences, no preamble.

PROMPT_B_AETNA = """\
You are extracting structured medical benefit drug policy criteria from an Aetna Clinical \
Policy Bulletin (CPB) document. Your output feeds a clinical decision support system.

Document metadata:
- Payer: Aetna
- CPB Number: {policyNumber}
- Document Title: {documentTitle}
- Effective Date: {effectiveDate}

DOCUMENT STRUCTURE — Aetna CPBs follow this template. Navigate by section name:

STEP 1 — Extract prescriber requirements from the "Prescriber Specialties" section.
This section contains per-indication specialist mappings, e.g.:
  "Crohn's disease: gastroenterologist or colorectal surgeon"
  "Rheumatoid arthritis: rheumatologist"
Build a lookup: {{ indicationName: prescriberType }}

STEP 2 — Extract initial criteria from "Criteria for Initial Approval" section.
Organized as numbered sections by indication.

  INDICATION DETECTION: "1. [Indication Name]" marks the beginning of each indication block.

  LOGIC MARKERS (look for italic text or emphasis patterns as signals):
  - "*all* of the following" → AND
  - "*any* of the following" → OR (3+ alternatives)
  - "*either* of the following" → OR (exactly 2 alternatives)

  AUTHORIZATION DURATION: Look for "Authorization of [N] months may be granted" — typically \
  appears as the first sentence within an indication block, before the criteria list.

  STEP THERAPY: Aetna specifies step therapy with dose AND duration together. Example:
  "3-month trial of methotrexate at maximum titrated dose of at least 15 mg per week"
  Extract: trialDurationWeeks (convert months to weeks: 3 months = ~12 weeks), \
  stepTherapyMinDoseMg (15 mg), stepTherapyDoseFrequency ("per week").

STEP 3 — Extract continuation criteria from the SEPARATE "Continuation of Therapy" section.
This section is NOT per-indication — it covers all indications with general response \
documentation requirements.

STEP 4 — Extract dosing from the "Dosing" TABLE (if present):
| Indication | Dose |
Capture: indicationName, doseMgPerKg, frequency, infusionSchedule (e.g., "at 0, 2, 6 weeks \
then every 8 weeks")

STEP 5 — Extract excluded indications from "Experimental, Investigational, or Unproven" \
section. Each listed condition should be extracted as a separate record with \
coveredStatus: "experimental".

STEP 6 — Extract ICD-10 codes from the "Coding" section tables. Match to indications.

Pre-extracted ICD-10 mapping (use this to populate indicationICD10 fields):

# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
PROMPT_C_CIGNA = """\
You are extracting structured medical benefit drug policy criteria from a Cigna Drug \
Coverage Policy document (type IP####). Your output feeds a clinical decision support system.

Document metadata:
- Payer: Cigna
- Coverage Policy Number: {policyNumber}
- Document Title: {documentTitle}
- Effective Date: {effectiveDate}

DOCUMENT STRUCTURE — Cigna IP documents follow this template:

STEP 1 — IGNORE the "INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE" section at the beginning of the document.
It is identical boilerplate across all Cigna policies. Begin reading at "OVERVIEW".

STEP 2 — From the "OVERVIEW" section, extract:
- All FDA-approved indications (bulleted list)
- All product names (brand and biosimilar) listed in the policy title and overview

STEP 2.5 — PLAN-TIER DETECTION (CRITICAL):
BEFORE parsing criteria, scan the Coverage Policy section for plan-tier qualifiers. \
Cigna policies may scope criteria to specific plan types:
  - "Pathwell Specialty" / "Pathwell" → step therapy or additional restrictions apply \
    ONLY to Pathwell Specialty plans, NOT to standard employer group plans
  - "Open Access Plus" / "OAP" → criteria apply only to OAP plans
  - "Standard Employer Group" / "Employer Group" → default plan tier
  - If NO plan-tier qualifier is present, the criteria apply to ALL plan types → \
    set planTierRestriction to null
Plan-tier qualifiers typically appear as:
  - Section headers: "For Pathwell Specialty Plans:"
  - Inline text: "Applicable to Pathwell Specialty plans only"
  - Footnotes: "*Pathwell Specialty step therapy requirement"
Extract the plan-tier restriction as planTierRestriction on each record.

STEP 3 — Parse the "Coverage Policy" section — this is the core extraction target.
It uses a NESTED numbered/lettered structure:

  TOP-LEVEL INDICATION:
  "[NUMBER]. [Indication Name]. Approve for the duration noted if the patient meets ONE \
  of the following (A or B):"
  → TOP-LEVEL LOGIC IS ALWAYS "OR" between branches A and B
  → A = Initial Therapy branch
  → B = Continuation/Currently Receiving branch

  BRANCH A (Initial Therapy):
  "A) Initial Therapy. Approve for [N] months if the patient meets BOTH of the following \
  (i and ii):"
  → BRANCH A LOGIC IS "AND" — all sub-criteria (i, ii, iii...) must be met
  → Extract N as initialAuthDurationMonths

  BRANCH B (Continuation/Currently Receiving):
  "B) Patient is Currently Receiving. Approve for [N] months if the patient meets ALL \
  of the following (i and ii):"
  → BRANCH B LOGIC IS "AND"
  → Extract N as maxAuthDurationMonths for reauthorizationCriteria

  NESTED CRITERIA:
  Within Branch A, sub-criteria use roman numerals (i, ii, iii) and sometimes further \
  nesting with letters (a, b, c). Example nested OR:
  "iii. Patient has had inadequate response to ONE of the following (a, b, or c):
        a. Methotrexate
        b. Leflunomide
        c. Sulfasalazine"
  → This is an OR block nested INSIDE the AND block of Branch A.
  → For the step therapy criterion, set logicOperator: "OR" on the sub-items.

  PRESCRIBER: Look for "The medication is prescribed by or in consultation with a [SPECIALIST]"

  STEP THERAPY:
  - Look for "inadequate response, intolerance, or contraindication to" — all three reasons \
    count as valid prior drug failure outcomes
  - "minimum [N]-month trial" → trialDurationWeeks = N * 4
  - "at therapeutic dose" → note in criterionText

  PLAN-TIER-SCOPED STEP THERAPY:
  - If step therapy criteria appear under a Pathwell section header, set \
    planTierRestriction: "pathwell_specialty" on those criteria records
  - If the same indication has criteria outside the Pathwell section (applying to \
    standard employer plans), extract SEPARATE records with planTierRestriction: null

  APPROVAL DURATIONS:
  - Initial (Branch A): "Approve for [N] months if..." → initialAuthDurationMonths
  - Continuation (Branch B): "Approve for [N] months if..." → maxAuthDurationMonths
  - These are DIFFERENT values — extract both separately

STEP 4 — From "Coding Information" section, extract ICD-10 codes per indication.
Usually in a table format. Map to indication names.

Pre-extracted ICD-10 mapping (use this to populate indicationICD10 fields):
{icd10Json}

  "dosingLimits": null,
  "combinationRestrictions": [],
  "benefitType": "medical",
  "coveredStatus": "covered",
  "confidence": number
}}

CRITICAL RULES:
- The "ONE of the following (A or B)" at the top of each indication creates TWO SEPARATE \
  records: initialAuthCriteria (from Branch A) and reauthorizationCriteria (from Branch B).
  Never mix Branch A and Branch B criteria.
- preferredProducts MUST be left empty — this data comes from the companion PSM document.
- "Approve for [N] months" appears TWICE per indication — once in Branch A (initial), \
  once in Branch B (continuation). Extract BOTH.
- "ONE of the following (a, b, or c)" within Branch A = OR logic. "BOTH of the following" \
  within Branch A = AND logic. Preserve this in logicOperator.
- For step therapy, "inadequate response, intolerance, OR contraindication" — all three \
  are acceptable failure reasons; do not restrict to only "inadequate response".
- PLAN-TIER SCOPING: If criteria are scoped to specific plan types (e.g., Pathwell \
  Specialty), set planTierRestriction accordingly. If criteria have NO plan-tier \
  qualifier, they apply universally — set planTierRestriction to null. A drug with \
  step therapy ONLY for Pathwell plans should produce a record with \
  planTierRestriction: "pathwell_specialty" and the step therapy criteria, plus a \
  separate record with planTierRestriction: null and NO step therapy for standard plans.
- Ignore the "INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE" boilerplate. It starts with "This Coverage Policy \
  addresses coverage determinations..." and ends before "OVERVIEW".
- Do NOT invent values. Return ONLY the JSON array. No explanation, no markdown.

4. Excluded products (e.g., Daxxify) — explicitly excluded from coverage (coveredStatus: "excluded").

STEP 1 — Extract universalCriteria from the "General Requirements" section. \
These apply to every record in the output.

STEP 2 — For each product section, identify the product name and extract its specific indications.

STEP 3 — For each product + indication:
  - Initial authorization criteria
  - Continuation criteria
  - Authorization duration
  - Step therapy (e.g., Myobloc may require prior trial of another toxin)

STEP 4 — Extract "Unproven" conditions (coveredStatus: "unproven", empty criteria arrays).

STEP 5 — Identify excluded products (coveredStatus: "excluded", empty criteria arrays).

STEP 6 — Frequency cap (e.g., "no more frequently than every 12 weeks") → add to \
universalCriteria AND to dosingLimits.maxFrequency.

You are extracting structured medical benefit drug policy criteria from a Cigna Drug \

Document metadata:
- Payer: Cigna
- Coverage Policy Number: {policyNumber}
- Document Title: {documentTitle}
- Effective Date: {effectiveDate}
- Structure Note: {payerStructureNote}

CRITICAL — THREE SEPARATE PHASES:
Each numbered indication has THREE separate approval paths. Extract EACH as a separate record \
with its own approvalPhase label. NEVER merge criteria from different phases into one record.

PHASE STRUCTURE per indication:
  A) Initial Therapy:
     "Approve for [N] months if the patient meets ALL of the following..."
     → approvalPhase: "initial", approvalDurationMonths: N
  B) Patient has received one prior course of therapy:
     "Approve for [N] months if ALL of the following..."
     → approvalPhase: "continuation_1", approvalDurationMonths: N
  C) Patient has received two or more prior courses:
     "Approve for [N] months if ALL of the following..."
     → approvalPhase: "continuation_2plus", approvalDurationMonths: N

STEP 1 — IGNORE "INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE" boilerplate at document start.

STEP 1.5 — PLAN-TIER DETECTION:
Scan the Coverage Policy section for plan-tier qualifiers before extracting criteria:
  - "Pathwell Specialty" / "Pathwell" → criteria apply ONLY to Pathwell Specialty plans
  - "Open Access Plus" / "OAP" → criteria apply only to OAP plans
  - If NO plan-tier qualifier is present, criteria apply to ALL plan types → \
    set planTierRestriction to null
Extract planTierRestriction on each record.

STEP 2 — Parse each numbered indication: "1. Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)"

STEP 3 — Within each indication, find Phase A, B, and C sub-sections.

STEP 4 — Extract criteria for each phase separately. \
"Approve for [N] months if..." → capture N as approvalDurationMonths for that phase.

STEP 5 — NOTE BLOCKS: Lines beginning with "Note:" are clarifications, NOT criteria. \
Do NOT create a CriteriaItem for "Note:" lines. You may incorporate their content into \
the criterionText of the immediately preceding criterion if directly relevant.

STEP 6 — DOSING: Each indication may have a dosing sub-section. \
Extract as dosingPerIndication entries.

STEP 7 — "Conditions Not Covered" section at end: extract as records with \
coveredStatus: "excluded".

You are extracting preferred product program data from a Blue Cross Blue Shield \
Preferred Injectable Oncology policy or similar preferred product program document.

CRITICAL: FDA Approved Use / FDA-Approved Indications sections are REFERENCE LISTS only. \
Do NOT extract their contents as clinical coverage criteria.

Document metadata:
- Payer: {payerName}
- Policy Number: {policyNumber}
- Document Title: {documentTitle}
- Effective Date: {effectiveDate}
- Structure Note: {payerStructureNote}

DOCUMENT STRUCTURE:
This document contains MULTIPLE drug class sections. Each drug class has its OWN \
preferred products and non-preferred products. You MUST isolate extraction to the \
specific drug class section you are processing.

STEP 1 — DRUG CLASS SECTION BOUNDARY DETECTION:
Identify drug class section headers in the document. They follow patterns like:
  - "[Drug Name] Agents" (e.g., "Bevacizumab Agents", "Rituximab Agents")
  - "[Drug Class]" as a standalone section header
  - Bold or capitalized drug class names followed by product tables
Each drug class section ENDS where the next drug class section header begins, \
or at the end of the document.

STEP 2 — WITHIN EACH DRUG CLASS SECTION:
  - Extract ONLY the preferred products listed IN THAT SECTION
  - Extract ONLY the non-preferred products listed IN THAT SECTION
  - Extract ONLY the exception criteria listed IN THAT SECTION
  - Step therapy is PRODUCT-TIER-BASED: non-preferred product requires \
    trial/failure of the preferred product FROM THE SAME DRUG CLASS

STEP 3 — KNOWN BIOSIMILAR FAMILIES (use to verify correct assignment):
  - bevacizumab biosimilars: Mvasi, Zirabev, Avastin (reference)
  - rituximab biosimilars: Riabni, Ruxience, Truxima, Rituxan (reference), \
    Rituxan Hycela (rituximab and hyaluronidase)
  - trastuzumab biosimilars: Ogivri, Herzuma, Ontruzant, Trazimera, Kanjinti, \
    Herceptin (reference), Herceptin Hylecta
  NEVER assign a biosimilar from one family to a different drug class record. \
  If you see Mvasi or Zirabev, they belong to bevacizumab ONLY. \
  If you see Riabni, Ruxience, or Truxima, they belong to rituximab ONLY.

STEP 4 — REFERENCED DOCUMENTS:
If the policy text references external documents for per-indication criteria \
(e.g., "see Table 1", "refer to [Policy Name]", "criteria in [document]"), \
extract these references. These indicate that full clinical criteria live in a \
separate linked policy document.

EXTRACTION TASK — For each drug class, extract ONE preferred product program record:

CRITICAL RULES:
- FDA Approved Use sections = reference only. Do NOT extract as criteria.
- DRUG CLASS ISOLATION: Each record's preferredProducts and nonPreferredProducts MUST \
  come from the SAME drug class section. NEVER mix products across drug classes. \
  Mvasi/Zirabev = bevacizumab ONLY. Riabni/Ruxience/Truxima = rituximab ONLY.
- Step therapy is product-tier: preferred must be tried before non-preferred, \
  and the preferred product must be FROM THE SAME DRUG CLASS.
- documentationRequirements = prescriber attestations, medical records, or clinical \
  notes required when requesting non-preferred product exception.
- referencedDocuments = any external policy documents referenced for full clinical \
  criteria (e.g., "Table 1" references). Extract the document title and the exact \
  reference text from the policy.
- Return a JSON array (one element per drug class). No explanation, no markdown.

CRITICAL RULES:
- Parse conditional logic precisely. "All of the following" = AND (all must be \
met). "One of the following" = OR (any one sufficient). Track this in logicOperator.
- Each indication section is INDEPENDENT. Never merge criteria across indications.
- If a criterion references another policy document, note this in criterionText \
but do not follow the reference.
- Normalized drug names only: "infliximab" not "REMICADE®"
- If a field is not specified in the document, omit it entirely. Do not invent values.
- Rate confidence below 0.7 if: the section is ambiguous, uses complex \
conditional logic, or references external policies.

Return a valid JSON array of DrugPolicyCriteriaRecord objects. Return ONLY the \
JSON array. No explanation, no markdown fences, no preamble.

You are comparing two versions of the same payer's medical benefit drug policy \
to identify what changed and how significant those changes are for patients and \

New policy effective: {newDate}

OLD policy criteria:
{oldPolicyJson}

NEW policy criteria:

For each indication covered, identify ALL changes. For each change:
- field: which field changed ("step_therapy"|"preferred_products"|"dosing"|\
"auth_duration"|"prescriber_requirement"|"combination_restrictions"|\
"indication_added"|"indication_removed")
- oldValue: previous value (string representation)
- newValue: new value
- severity:
  - "breaking" — coverage removed, new step therapy barrier added, dosing \
limit reduced, indication removed
  - "restrictive" — additional documentation required, auth period shortened, \
new combination restriction
  - "relaxed" — step therapy removed, dosing expanded, indication added, \
fewer prior failures required
  - "neutral" — rewording only, administrative change, no functional clinical \
impact
- humanSummary: one sentence in plain English, written for a pharmacy \
consultant. Be specific about what changed and what it means.

If there are NO functional changes between versions, return an empty changes \
array.
